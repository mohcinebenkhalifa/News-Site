                <h3>Moroccan Students Thrive at Renowned American Universities</h3>
                <p>Rabat - On the night of March 31, 2022, Alae Aboussad’s father woke her up with an announcement she never expected to hear: She had been accepted into undergraduate studies at Harvard, a highly selective Ivy League university with a 3.19% acceptance rate in 2020.

                    Shocked and disoriented, the 18-year-old girl from Tamesna, Morocco sat in her bed, wondering if she was still dreaming.
                    
                    “Then, it was euphoria,” Aboussad said.
                    
                    While Moroccans tend to choose French universities because of their language skills, young Moroccans are now experiencing a shift toward learning English. With that, studying abroad in English-speaking universities is becoming increasingly attractive.
                    
                    Morocco World News (MWN) spoke with four undergraduates who are Moroccan or of Moroccan descent, all of whom attend prestigious American universities. </p>

                    The Moroccan school will receive a prize of 1 million Emirati dirhams ($ 272,000), allowing it to devote more resources to building a culture of reading and academic and cognitive success.
                    
                    UAE Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum shared on his twitter account, “As part of the reading challenge, from 92,000 schools that participated, Al Mokhtar Jazoulit School from the Kingdom of Morocco won as the best school that supports reading and consolidates it in our generations.”
                    
                    “Congratulations to Morocco for this cultural movement, as one million Moroccan students participated in the challenge,” the tweet read.</p>

    <h1>Kaspersky: 90% of Employees Need Basic Cybersecurity Training</h1>
    <p>Rabat - Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky has reported that 90% of employees need basic training in cybersecurity.

        The assessment led by Kaspersky saw the participation of 3,907 employees from January 2021 to September 2022. 
        
        With 90% of employees “overestimating” their cybersecurity skills, Kaspersky developed the Gamified Assessment Tool to assist IT and HR officers in measuring workers’ cyber skills and provide them with a relevant learning environment.
        
        The tool awards points to employees based on decisions they make during their working day. The participants are later asked to assess whether their decisions “carry cyber risks.”
        
        According to Kaspersky, only one out of 10 participants (11%) scored more than 90% on the test. These workers received a Certificate of Excellence and demonstrated a high level of cybersecurity awareness.</p>

        <h1>UN Lauds Morocco’s New Education Reform Plan for 2022-2026</h1>
        <p>Rabat - Morocco’s human-centered developmental process is “committed to transforming” the country’s schools, Acting Resident Coordinator of the United Nations System in Morocco François Reybet-Degat said on Wednesday.


            Commenting on Morocco’s 2022-2026 roadmap for education reform, Reybet-Degat explained how he sees the strategy would contribute to the “success” of the public schooling enterprise in the country.
            
            “While like all other countries in the world, the Kingdom of Morocco is facing challenges in terms of quality and equity of education, the United Nations in Morocco welcomes the translation of Morocco's ambitious commitments in the new Roadmap (2022-2026),” Reybet-Degat said in a statement reported by Moroccan state press agency.
            
            The 2022-2026 roadmap covers three areas of interest and lists 12 specific commitments. The new reform aims to improve governance, boost the level of engagement of the different stakeholders in the reform process, and rethink the sector’s funding.
