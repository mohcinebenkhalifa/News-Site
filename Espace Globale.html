                <h3>Omar Hilale Renews Morocco's Commitment to Pan-Atlantic Cooperation</h3>
                <p>Rabat - Morocco has been among the first voices calling for pan-Atlantic cooperation between the four continents sharing the Atlantic, Morocco’s Permanent Representative for the UN, Omar Hilale, said on Friday.


                    Speaking at the 11th annual “ Atlantic Dialogues Conference” Hilale explained that Morocco has historically expressed interest in promoting pan-Atlantic cooperation. The country hosted the first Ministerial Conference of west African states in 2009. 
                    
                    Successful pan-Atlantic cooperation has much to offer to states sharing the Atlantic ocean, Hilale insisted, highlighting the myriad economic opportunities such an alliance could bring about The ocean currently supports economic activities that generate roughly 43% of the world’s Gross Domestic Production (GDP). </p>

        <h1>Loans Granted to Non-Financial Companies In Morocco Dropped In 2021</h1>
        <p>Rabat - While already underfunded, companies in Morocco have had a harder time having access to bank loans in 2021 compared to the previous year.

            Excluding the financial sector, other Moroccan companies have locked MAD 1.2 billion ($114 million) in loans in 2021, down from MAD 7.4 billion (702 million) in 2020, according to data from Morocco’s Higher Commission of Planning (HCP), the country’s state-owned economic intelligence center.
            
            Having access to financing is crucial for companies to overcome operational hurdles, and fund expansion operations that would unlock growth potential.</p>
