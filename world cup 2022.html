                <h3>France: Far-Right Groups Target Moroccan Football Fans</h3>
                <p>Rabat - French far-right groups have begun to target Moroccan football fans, citing rare instances of violence following Wednesday’s 2-0 victory for France in the semi-finals.

                    Mathilde Panot, President of the left-wing La France Insoumise group at France’s National Assembly, took to the media to express concern over the actions of far-right groups in the country.
                    
                    “We have been alerted that there could be actions akin to beatings against supporters of the Moroccan team,” Panot said. “I am very worried about far-right groups in our country.” </p>

                <p>Rabat - Morocco’s captain Romain Saiss is set to star in a Netflix behind-the-scenes documentary for the 2022 World Cup titled “Captains,” media reports indicated.

                    While the Wales national team exited the competition at the group stage, and Brazil suffered an early quarter-finals exit at the hands of Croatia, Morocco’s team exceeded expectations and made history by qualifying to the semi-finals.</p>

    <h1>FRMF Protests Refereeing of Morocco-France Game, Calls for Justice</h1>
    <p>Rabat - Morocco’s Royal Federation of Football (FRMF) said that it has “strongly protested” to FIFA about the “unjust” refereeing during yesterday’s World Cup semi-finals game between Morocco and reigning champions France.

        Wednesday’s game was officiated by Mexican referee Cesar Ramos, who has received immense criticism from football fans and sports experts for his “biased” and “unfair” decisions in favor of the French side.
        
        Fans notably questioned the yellow card Ramos gave Moroccan footballer Sofiane Boufal when he and French defender Theo Hernandez collided during the first half of the game inside Les Bleus’ box. Instead of awarding Morocco a penalty as many expected, the Mexican referee penalized Boufal and gave him a yellow card.</p>

        <h1>Football and politics are two sides of the same coin</h1>
        <p>I am still convinced that politics and sports are two sides of the same national coin, if their source is the same, which is giving priority to the interest of the nation over the interest of individuals, and raising the head of the nation at home by respecting the will of the people, and abroad by raising the flag of the nation. And he played his anthem in all the forums. And my evidence for what I say is that the term sport is derived from the verb satisfied, tame, so it is a sporty and athletic. Whoever succeeds in “tame” his mind, heart, and movements to control the game in which he specializes, becomes an athlete. And as long as we are close to winning the African Cup of Nations, the comparison will be easier, as we saw our team taming the ball as if it were computer keys. Politics is the act of Sass, so he is a politician and a politician. Whoever was able to lead the masses to their goals, push them to embrace their longings, avoid their reactions, and avoid the policy of arm-twisting, was a politician who mastered the quadrilateral of pulling a hair out of dough.
